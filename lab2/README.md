# Day 2 tasks

For today, you'll going to have to do the following:

* [ ]  Go to the `tasks/` folder, and complete all the functions marked with TODO: in the index.js file
* [ ]  In the `api/` folder, you have the necessary functions of a command line API client for the `typicode` API. Fill in the functions and make it work by calling the `addPost`, `getPosts` and `deletePost` functions from the browser's command line
* [ ]  In the `apiInterface/` folder, you will have to reuse the `api/` files in order to make a Postman-like interface for the API. Add event listeners to the buttons and output the result from the API in the `div` in the HTML.
* [ ]  In the `notifyMe/` folder, you already have a setup for a notification request. Trigger a notification when pressing the button.
* [ ]  In the `imageGif/` folder, you have an array of image locations and an `img` object. Can you make a GIF out of them ?
